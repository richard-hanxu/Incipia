# Incipia

This is a project I started to learn how interpreters work, and to also learn C++. The code in this repository is heavily derived from [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html). As their guide is written in Java and my code is written in C++, I currently read through, understand, and reimplement the features in each chapter.

## WIP

I have currently implemented features up to and including "Chapter 6: Parsing Expressions". My goal is to eventually make my way through the whole book.
